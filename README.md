### Description

One of the big issues in procuring personality insights from linguistic data is that the two major software systems that do so, [LIWC](https://liwc.wpengine.com/) and [IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/personality-insights/index.html), are not open source. We have little, if any, idea what goes on behind-the-scenes. On top of that, those two systems are not (entirely) free.

This is my attempt to implement a system like LIWC or IBM Watson that can predict the personality aspects of the author of a piece of writing.
